abstract = {For some years now, master data has become extremely relevant to business success and continuity in an increasingly competitive and global business environment. The banking sector is one example of how the implementation of well-structured and designed master data management policies and initiatives is crucial for reaching positive results. One of the areas in which banks need to ensure extremely fruitful master data management approaches and data governance procedures is when dealing with risk-related data, as it not only ensures accurate and well-supported management and decision-making, but also because banks are required to do so by imposed regulations, such as the BCBS 239. Drawing on a DSR methodology supported research project, where banking and IS-related expertise was continuously merged with existing theoretical knowledge on MDM and BCBS 239 related topics, and a permanent focus on the technical and functional complexity associated with implementing master data management and well-established data governance procedures that ensure regulatory compliance, we propose a novel, six-phase action plan that will allow banks to ensure compliance with BCBS 239 and, consequently, ensure efficient and effective risk data management and reporting.}
